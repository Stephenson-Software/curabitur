"""Reports that the curabitur chat client was used to the trace service, and nothing else.

What is sent: the program's name (``curabitur``) and version with a ``startup``
event tagged ``role`` = ``client``, and a ``connected`` event with the same tag
when it connects to a server. Nothing about you, your machine, the addresses or
the messages.

Reporting is on by default. The first launch writes a ``usage_reporting``
block to ``client/settings.json`` and prints a one-line notice saying so and how to
turn it off; setting ``enabled`` to ``false`` there does. So do the
``TRACE_USAGE_REPORTING=off`` and ``DO_NOT_TRACK=1`` environment variables,
which every trace client honours and which win over the settings file because
the client checks them first. Every call returns immediately and never raises:
the network happens on a daemon thread owned by the vendored client in
``trace_client.py``. Details: https://github.com/Stephenson-Software/trace#usage-reporting
